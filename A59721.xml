            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen wee laid down and gave you the learning of the Office of the Juſtice of the Peace without Warrants, wee ſhewed you what they might do:
<pb facs="tcp:49126:3"/> but did not ſhew you how they might do it: By the want whereof it hath been found, in our own and other mens ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that Juſtice hath been ſomtimes hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred; for the Juſtice of the Peace, well knowing the danger of ſending abroad a Warrant not warranted by the Law, both to himſelf, and the inferior Officer that ſhall execute it, and not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a ſafe Warrant in
<pb facs="tcp:49126:3"/> readineſſe, hee hath not (eſpecially in a caſe not common) thought it ſafe to truſt his Clerk here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and oft-times by this means the offender hath eſcaped. We have been therefore much preſſed to make a ſupply herein, and did purpoſe to have done it in the next Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Office of the Juſtice of Peace, which (if God will) may ere long with many additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and alterations bee
<pb facs="tcp:49126:4"/> diſpatched, but that it would then have made the Booke too big. Wherefore wee have thought it beſt to let the Reader have them aſunder, that they may be fit Pocket-books for the Maſter and his Man, as they pleaſe. Wee know that ſomething hath been done of this ſubject before by others, But by that time it hath been ſeen what we have done, wee are well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
<pb facs="tcp:49126:4"/> it will be ſaid, That which wee have done herein was not without need, and will bee very pleaſing and profitable to the Juſtice of Peace his Clerk, and his Maſter alſo: and will be well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of all men.</p>

            <head>CHAP. I. <hi>Of a Warrant and Order of the Juſtices of the Peace in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Warrant of the Juſtice of Peace is his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand <note place="margin">What it is.</note> to an inferiour Officer to do ſomething belonging to his Office. And this in ſome ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al caſes may be good by word of mouth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out writing. But of this we ſpeak not here. Or it may be and muſt be in moſt caſes in writing. And herein theſe Rules and Adviſes are to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and heeded.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Juſtice is to take care to pen his War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant <note place="margin">Rules con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it.</note> plain and clear, and not ambiguous and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, ſo that the Officer muſt be forced to enquire what may be his meaning by his words.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let the Warrant be compleat when the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of Peace doth put his hand to it; for it is dangerous to let it go with blanks, and give other men leave to fill it up.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:49126:10"/> 3. The ſtile of his Warrant, it may be in the name of the Kings Majeſty, thus, <hi>Charles the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, by the Grace of God,</hi> &amp;c. with the Teſte un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of the Juſtice that makes it (which is not uſual) or it may be ſtiled and made in the name of the Juſtice of Peace, thus. W. S. Eſquire, one of the Juſtices, &amp;c. and this is the uſual form. Or it may be made without any ſtile, onely under the Teſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e of the Juſtice of Peace, thus, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint being made to me, &amp;c. Theſe are, &amp;c. Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the ſaid W. S. &amp;c. Or it may be without any Teſte of the Juſtice of Peace, being ſubſcribed by him, and ſealed where ſealing is neceſſary.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We do not conceive it neceſſary to uſe theſe words in the Warrant, Theſe are (in the name of the Kings Majeſty) to require: but it is ſufficient to ſay, Theſe are to require you: howbeit the Warrant doth carry the more majeſty in it, when th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe words are uſed in it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Title of direction may be either above the Warrant, thus, To the Conſtable of Dale: o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in the body of the Warrant, thus, W. S. Eſquire, &amp;c. to the Conſtable of Dale. Whereas, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Warrant may be directed to any Officer, as the Sheriff, his Bayliffs, Conſtables, Tything-men, or to others that are no Officers, thus, To the Sheriff of the County of G. or to the Bayliff Itine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the County of G. or to the Bayliff of the hundred of R. or to the Conſtable of the hundred of R. in the County of G. or to the Conſtable of the Town or Village of Dale, or to the Tything-man of Dale; as the Officer there is called, if it can be known. Otherwiſe, the beſt way is to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect it to all the Conſtables and Tything-men of Dale within the County of G. and every of them.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49126:10"/> Or it may be directed to all theſe Officers toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to the Sheriff, and to all Bayliffs, High-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables of Hundreds, and Conſtables and Tything-men of Towns and Pariſhes within the County of G. and every of them jointly and ſeverally. Or it may be directed to theſe Officers and to others that are no Officers together. Or to them that are no Officers alone, thus. To I S. and W S. both of Dale in the County of Glouc. and to either of them. But this muſt be underſtood of Warrants of the Peace, good Behaviour, and ſuch like Warrants, wherein the Juſtice of the Peace is left at liberty to direct his Warrant to whom he will: For if the Law doth direct him to whom he muſt ſend his Warrant, as divers Acts of Parliament do; ſome of them appointing him to direct his Warrant to the Conſtables, ſome to the Conſtables and Churchwardens, ſome to the Churchwardens, ſome to the Conſtables or Churchwardens, ſome to the Churchwardens and Overſeers of the Poor; He in theſe caſes that makes the Warrant muſt take great care that he do purſue the direction of the Statute punctually; for it is dangerous to vary from it ever ſo little: And therefore the Title ſet down in the Preſidents for the Warrants muſt be followed, and not altered. And when the Title of direction is to more then one, there it is good to add theſe words, [And to every of them] and to ſay in the body of the Warrant, Theſe are to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize and require you, and every of you. But the beſt way is, to direct it to the common and known Officer, which is the High-Conſtable of the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, or Conſtable of the Town, in all caſes where it is left to the Juſtice of Peace to direct it to whom he pleaſe.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:49126:11"/> 7. The word [greeting] To I S. &amp;c. Greeting, uſed in Warrants, may be left out: ſo may theſe words of Addition, To the Juſtices of our Lord the King, aſſigned to keep the Peace, and to hear and determine Felonies, &amp;c. and it is enough to ſay, Juſtices of the Peace of (or within) the County of Glouceſter.</p>
            <p n="8">8. It is not amiſs to ſay the place wherein the Officer dwels to whom the Warrant is directed is within the County. To the Conſtable of Dale within the County of Glouceſter. And ſo of other places named within the Warrant, to ſay they are within the ſame County.</p>
            <p n="9">9. It is not amiſs, if the Warrant recite a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of an offence, to let it expreſs where the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence was done, thus; I S. being convict before me that he was drunk (at Dale in this County;) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in many caſes the forfeiture is given to the poor of the place where the offence is done.</p>
            <p n="10">10. It is good alſo now to expreſs the time when the offence was committed, thus; I S. being duly convict before me that he was drunk at Dale in this County (the firſt day of May laſt) or within three moneths laſt paſt, or ſince the firſt of May laſt paſt, that it may appear the offence was done ſince the general Pardon: and in ſome caſes this is, if not neceſſary, yet very convenient, when the offence is by the Law to be puniſhed within a certain time, or not at all, there it is good to ſay that the offence was done within that time.</p>
            <p n="11">11. It is good alſo to expreſs the place of the making of the Warrant, and it muſt be ſome place within the County, thus; Dated at Dale, given under my Hand and Seal at Dale in the ſame County. But if it ſay it was dated at one place,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49126:11"/> and be dated at another place, yet the Warrant is good, and it ſhall be taken to be dated where the Warrant doth ſay it was dated.</p>
            <p n="12">12. The day and year alſo, being the time of the making of the ſame Warrant, muſt be expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Warrant.</p>
            <p n="13">13. The Warrant (being a Warrant of Arreſt) may be to require the Officer to bring the offender before the Juſtice that makes the Warrant, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him or ſome other Juſtice of the County; and either of theſe forms is good: but the beſt form is, to require the Officer to bring him before the Juſtice of Peace himſelf that made the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</p>
            <p n="14">14. In every Warrant for the Peace, or good Behaviour, where Sureties are to be found or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, the Warrant ought to contain the ſpecial cauſe or matter, to the intent that the party ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted may be provided with Sureties. But if it be for ſome great crime, the cauſe may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed.</p>
            <p n="15">15. In every Warrant to command an Officer to carry a man to Goal, it is not amiſs to inſert a clauſe at the end of the Warrant to command the Gaoler to receive him, to this purpoſe. That you him convey to the common Gaol of this County, and him deliver to the Gaoler or his Deputy there, who are hereby required him to receive and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in their cuſtody as a Priſoner, until he ſhall be from thence delivered by a due courſe of Law.</p>
            <p n="16">16. There is a neceſſity in it, that the Juſtice of Peace do ſubſcribe his name to his Warrant. But that he ſhould put to his Seal in every caſe, is not needfull; for in a Warrant of the Peace, or
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49126:12"/> good Behaviour it is not needfull, nor where an Act of Parliament ſaith, That the Juſtice by War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant (or by Warrant under his hand) may do ſuch a thing. But if the Law ſay, He may or ſhall do it by Warrant under his Hand and Seal, there the Warrant muſt be under his Hand and Seal, or it is not good. And therefore heed muſt be given to our Preſidents herein, where we ſay, Given under our Hands and Seals; and in thoſe caſes the Juſtice muſt put his Hand and Seal to the Warrant, or it is not well done. And for this cauſe we do adviſe the Juſtice to put his Seal to every Warrant.</p>
            <p n="17">17. There is little difference between a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of Commitment, and a Mittimus; for both are to do one thing, and they differ a little onely in the form. It will be eaſie therefore to make one of them by the other.</p>
            <p n="18">18. It is uſual to grant Warrants againſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders upon penal Laws to bind them over to Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions before they be indicted of the offence, in caſes where there is no ſpecial power or direction given by the Statute ſo to do. But we dare not adviſe men ſo to do, being unſatisfied of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs thereof. But we agree it to be clear and ſafe, that after the offender is indicted of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and the Bill found, or after the offence found by Preſentment of the grand Jury, to be bound over to the next Quarter Seſſions to anſwer it, and alſo to put in Sureties for his good Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in the mean time, if the offence for which he is indicted will warrant it. As if he be indicted for ſelling Ale, contrary to the Juſtices order, or the like. So alſo in caſes where a Law doth give a ſpecial command and power to any Juſtice of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49126:12"/> Peace to bind over an offender to the Seſſions, as the Statute of 5 Eliz. 4. touching Maſters and Apprentices; the Law of 23 Eliz. 10. touching Hawking in eared or codded corn; 1 Ed. 6. chap. 1. 23 Eliz. chap. 10. and ſome others do. In theſe caſes they may bind them over before Indictment. But then it is beſt firſt to ſend a Warrant of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to call in the party offender before the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to anſwer the matter; and then if he appear, and he ſee no cauſe to forbear to bind him over, to do it. And if he do not appear, then he may ſend for him, and bind him over, and bind him to the good Behaviour alſo for his contempt. For which there are Preſidents prepared amongſt the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents ſet down in this Book.</p>
            <p n="19">19. Where a Statute doth give power to a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of Peace to compel men to do any thing, in order hereunto he may ſend his Warrant to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire them to come before him, and in caſe of their refuſal, proceed in the law.</p>
            <p n="20">20. The Juſtices of the Peace may ſend their Warrants for any thing that doth relate to a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Seſſions, either to compel appearance or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance there, or execution of any thing there done, under their own Hands, if they pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aſe; or they may let it be done by the Clerk of the Peace, as the buſineſs of the Quarter-Seſſions is done.</p>
            <p n="21">21. What may be done by the Warrant of one Juſtice of the Peace alone, may be known by the penning of the Preſident; for if it be penned to be made by one Juſtice, (as, W S. &amp;c. Whereas it hath been proved before me, &amp;c.) then you may be ſure that one Juſtice of Peace alone may do the thing contained in the Warrant. And where two are named, there in moſt of the caſes two are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</p>
            <p n="22">
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:49126:13"/> 22. The ſame Preſident that ſerves upon a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction by witneſs, will ſerve upon a conviction by view or hearing. For I S. being lawfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed before me, is appliable to either, and will ſerve to both.</p>
            <p n="23">23. It is a good cloſe of every Warrant ſent to an Officer, to require him to give an account how he hath executed it, after this wiſe. And that you be then there with this Precept to give us an account of your execution of it. Or thus; And that you give me an account within fourteen days next following, of your execution of my War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat.</p>
            <p n="24">24. Where a Statute is penned thus, That the Conſtables or Churchwardens by Warrant from a Juſtice of Peace ſhall be enabled to do an act, in this caſe we conceive the Juſtice may juſtifie the making of that Warrant.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Warrants and Preſidents which concern the exerciſe of the Office of a Juſtice of Peace out of the General Seſſions, are of ſeveral ſorts, <hi>viz.</hi> They concern either Treaſons, Felonies, Miſpriſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Praemunires, forcible Entries, forcible De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers, Riots, Routs, and unlawfull Aſſemblies, Security of the Peace, and good Behaviour, or other miſdemeanors or offences of ſeveral ſorts.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As concerning Treaſons and Felonies, upon Information made of any Treaſon or Felony com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, any one Juſtice of Peace may direct his Warrant to the Sheriff, or to the High-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables, or Petty Conſtables, or to all or any of them, to make ſearch for the Traytors or Felons, and alſo for the ſtolen goods.</p>

               <note place="margin">1. Recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance, what it is.</note> A Recogniſance is a Bond of Record, teſtifying that the Recogniſor doth owe a certain ſum of money to our Soveraign Lord the King, with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that the Recogniſor ſhall do ſome other thing, for the which he is bound in that ſum in the nature of a penalty. Wherein theſe things are to be known.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Juſtices of the Peace do take Recogniſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:49126:54"/> for the Peace, good Behaviour, to bind men to appear at the Aſſizes, at the Seſſions, and for many other cauſes. And for this any one Juſtice may do it. But to Bail a Priſoner for Felony, take a Recogniſance of an Ale-houſe-keeper, and de ſome other things, there muſt be two Juſtices to do it, and one alone cannot do it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What ſum the parties ſhall be bound in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or what Sureties the Recogniſor ſhall have to be bound with him, it is left to the diſcretion of the Juſtice or Juſtices that doth take the Recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance, in caſes where the Law doth not ſet down the certainty, as in ſome caſes it doth; and there they muſt not vary from what is preſcribed, in the perſons bound, ſum, or manner of the Recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance. But for the Peace and good Behaviour, appearance at the Aſſizes and Seſſions, to give Evidence, and the like, the Juſtice may bind with what Sureties, and in what ſums he pleaſeth.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is ſaid, that Juſtices of Peace cannot bind over an offender againſt a penal Law, within their conuſance, (not within the Commiſſion of the Peace, nor committed to the power of any Juſtice of Peace,) except it be in a ſpecial caſe where the Law it ſelf doth enable them to do it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. All ſuch Recogniſances muſt be made to our Soveraign Lord the King himſelf, and to none other, and in his own name.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Juſtice of Peace need n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Bailment what it is.</note> BAilment or Mainpriſe (which is one kind of Recogniſance) is the ſaving or delivering of a man out of priſon, before that he hath ſatisfied the Law, by taking Surety of him that he ſhall appear and do it. Wherein theſe things are to be known.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Juſtice of Peace muſt not bail one that is not bailable by Law. And on the other ſide, he muſt bail him that is bailable by Law, or he may be puniſhed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In caſe of Felony, there muſt be two Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Peace, and they two together preſent with the Felon to bail him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Sureties and the Sum are in his diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but if it be in caſe of Felony, he muſt ſee he take good Sureties for the Priſoners appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and bind him in a good ſum to do it, or he may be fined for his neglect herein. If any Law appoint what the Sureties, and what the Sum ſhall be, that the party bailed muſt give, that muſt be purſued.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If the Juſtices ſhall at any time judge the Sureties inſufficient, they may compel the party bailed to put him in better Sureties, or commit him to Gaol for lack of Bail.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is ſaid, That if the Sureties doubt the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, that he will run away and not appear, that
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:49126:55"/> they may take him and carry him to the Juſtice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and deſire to be diſcharged, and that the Juſtice muſt diſcharge them, and that the principal is then to be committed till he put in new Sureties.</p>

            <p n="2">2. That there is very little difference between a Mittimus, and a Warrant of Commitment. This is to the Officer to take and carry a man to Priſon, and that to deliver him to the Gaoler, which doth
